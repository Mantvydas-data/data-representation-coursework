<h2 style="text-align: center;">ATU Data Representation Coursework Exercises</h2>

Weekly tasks for the module's CA:

<h4>Topic2:</h4>
___
    <p>Create an XML</p>
        <p>Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this).
        The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
        Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise).
        Books will have an ISBN, title and author.
        Upload your .xml file to your github repository called data-representation-coursework</p>

<h4>Topic 4:</h4>
___
    <p>Write a program</p>
        <p>Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"
        Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment.
        Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"
        This program should not be a long one
        I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way
        It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)
        You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance.</p>
