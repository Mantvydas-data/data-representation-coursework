Weekly tasks for the module's CA:

<h4>Topic 2:</h4>
    <p>Create an XML</p>
        <p>Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this).
        The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
        Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise).
        Books will have an ISBN, title and author.
